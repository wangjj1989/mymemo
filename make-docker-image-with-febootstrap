I want to create a CentOS5 base image by my self. But unfortunatly,
I can't install docker tools on CentOS 5. But considering docker image can be 
imported by docker tool with a CentOS 5 rootfs tar package. So comes this article.

1. Install a CentOS 5 virtual machine.

2. Install febootstrap tools on this virutal machine. This maybe a little triky because there 
is no febootstrap package in CentOS 5 yum repository. I install it by downloading approprite RPM package. During this process, you may also need to install its dependency packages and add fedora epel repository to CentOS5 's default repository.

3. Create a base image containing those packages you wanted.

            # mkdir centos5
            # febootstrap --names 'bash' 'ls' -o centos5
              (This means we will install bash and ls. Destinition directory is centos5.)


4. Reconstruct the image.
            # febootstrap-supermin-helper -f ext2 cetnos5 x86_64 kernel initrd root
              (Here, root is the rootfs image we wanted)

5. Then transfer this image to a host with docker engine.

6. Mount the image.
            
            # mount root /mnt
            # cd /mnt

7. Create docker image

            # tar -c . | docker import - centos5base
